Issues:
- data structures do not support custom comparatores
- data structures do not support more then integer max value (create them?)
- File api returns null for getParent(), getParentFile() for realtive paths instead of new File("")
- File doesn't contain visable function (should be usable for all desktops linux, macOs, windows)
- File renameTo doesn't work anymore
- ZipApi is trash
- shutdown hooks not working in command prompt terminals
- no standard libraries unlike c++ and python
- Date/Calendar objects are flawed
- no control for read / write / execute on windows and mac/linux and possibly android
- exiting doesn't fire from native terminals
- JFrame graphics
- HTTP errors are not properly handled. 404 is treated as FileNotFoundException and generic errors are generic IOExceptions make a new api wrapper that throws the proper errors
- no runnable.jar for the directory
- java user.dir doesn't update for File#getAbsolutePath and Paths#getAbsolutePath after updating it even though it's a simple string
- FTP doesn't support any error codes
