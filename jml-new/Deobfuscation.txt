#main mappings
type, simple name, obfuscated name, intermediate name, anyOtherDefinitions....
class, net/mc/block/Block, bk, d/c0000
field, net/mc/block/Block/hardness, bk/a, f0001
param, net/mc/block/Block/setHardness(I), bk/f(I), p004

#local variable mappings
method, index, classType, simpleName, obfuscated name
net/mc/Block/Block/setHardness(I), 0, Z;isWithinRange, Z;var0

rules local variables:
- looks at index first compares names if not look like the same variable it trys to find the name

rules mappings:
c0000
f0000
p0000
c=class
f=field
p=param
where the numbers range from 0-z-Z having 62 posibilities per charater that's 62^4 and can go up more if needed
class max value = cZZZZ class min value = c0000 an example: c000A > c000a
truncate local var from var0 to v0 d0uble0 to d0 as examples
classes are not in the default package to prevent acess errors
