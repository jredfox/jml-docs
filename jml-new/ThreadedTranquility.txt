Dynamically determines amount of parrell threads
Concurrent multi threading for networking or things that require I/O wait time
concurrent multi threads can only have a certain number of threads depending on their average IPS
Set threads afinity of main threads(parallelism) automatically
Set threads priority of main threads
Set the task of the process(per os) to high highest or realtime
Changes powerplan for max performance
uses mojang's trick's intel for performance for minecraft apis

hardware capabilities:
- compute IPS(instructions per second) average per cpu thread

uses for concurrent multithreading:
- for tasks that have a waiting period that don't max out the IPS
- for loading smaller tasks first like graphical loading(in mc chunk loading)
- for restricting what can execute when and enabling / disabling the thread

uses for parallelism:
- compute tasks simulationusly
- faster loading time due multiple tasks at the same time
