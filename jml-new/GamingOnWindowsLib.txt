Callable:
- Change Process Priority
- Change EXE GPU Preference (Windows 10+ Only)
- Create and apply new GPU power plan supporting AMD, NVIDIA, Intel
- Install / Uninstall Scripts

TODO:
- When Uninstalling Don't Delete Reg Files if you Can't Import them (Says no global and has global or no user and has user)
- SkipWithoutSID flags

Finalize Beta:
- use visual studio to compile GameModeLib from now on :( prevents false positive virus things
- create Policies HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\jredfox\GameModeLib and HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\jredfox\GameModeLib Values[DisableGameModeLib, DisableGPUEntries, DisableOEMGPUEntries, DisablePowerPlan]. Or Files for MacOs & Linux in both root (if allowed read) & appdata
- compile DLL version of GameModeLib (Main Program) and Wrapper calls for JNI(java)
- create visual basic installer and uninstaller (added to control pannel unisntall) for GameModeLib on windows
- NVIDIA GPU Entries (Windows 7+)
- AMD GPU Entries < 2020

TODO after Windows:
- MacOs(Priority maybe some other settings)
- Linux(Priority, GPU Entry, Touchpad, PowerPlan, Maybe Some Other Settings)

Help Wanted:
- NVIDIA DDS (Dynamic Display Switch aka MUX) 3D Setting support from editing NVIDIA3DSetting.cpp found in GameModeLib
- NVIDIA RTX Help is it Always Enabled with driver or is it a setting
- Palm Rejection, Palm Check, SmartSense
- Unchecking Disable TouchPad while typing from a registry edit
- Having to Press FN+F<1-12> keys before using them in games probably not being programtically possible if it's not per OEM
