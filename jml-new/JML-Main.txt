ModLoading:
- fast and clean
- loading order based on id and deps
- loading based on client, dedicated server, both
- loads per game and per api (minecraft could have my base api and other peoples apis)
- bytecode framework for easy base class editing and manipulation while still being compatible with other mods
- loading stages: game, registry
- registry
- points directly to mods / coremods / ats
- java standard library framework to help make modding with ease
- universal and or interchangeable apis for advanced compatability
- capabilities
- compatability (mods will be able to edit the same class while being compatible)
- central registry
- events? or a solution for events
- Builtin configurations for mods
- programable mod loader which binds it to a specified game by an api jar
- central registry where it can contain billions of indexes without taking up that much ram

Bytecode Framework:
- jar mods
- access transformers
- asm
- class unifyers
- easy enums
- capabilities

Fast Mod Loading:
- direct to mod classes
- direct to event classes
- direct points to ats
- direct points to coremods
- multi threading
- cached ASM
- fat jar for modpack final creation #all mods and libraries in a single jar speeds up loading time!

IDE Features:
- programable per game
- loader contains 0 game code
- everything public - final
- easy high level bytecode manipulation using Class Modification Unifyer (CMU)
- JML Developement kit (for compiling your mods)

Jar Sigining & Security Checks:
- for hash checking JML will use md5-sha1 the chances of both hashing algorithms failing are next to none
- secured mods will be encrypted and the key will be the meta-inf file's md5-sha1
- secured mods will crash if the meta-inf check fails even if decyrption is sucessfull.

modpack fingerprint:
- ability to determine quickly if the modpack configuration, mods, libs are the same
- uses dirtyClases.jar for the same fingerprint, however it will not skip asm for dynamic transformers if it's not found in dirtyclasses.jar

modpacks:
- can compile into a fatjar.jar with the modpack and all it's libs resources. transformed classes will still be dirtyClasses.jar and resources seperated
- fatjar can be compiled into a native fatjar. the ASM will all be precomputed into the jar before compilation the resources will be seperated. Final resutls: fatjar.exe, fatjar.pkg, fatjar.app etc... with x32, x64, arm64 depnding upon os and machine cpu architecture
- native fatjars will have to be recompiled if an ASM change occurs

Versional Mods:
- mods objects will be registered unless it's a duplicate from a previous version
- ModTag format is modid_version:objectType:object
- versional mods asm & event handling will only handled by the latest version and previous versions will only fire if allowed to by the highest version
- versional mods objects will have a registry mapping of all previous versions of the versional mod in which that object was duplicated by. for example 1.7 stone block is the same as 1.6 stone block

graphics apis:
- interchangeable graphics apis but the api will only support by default opengl
- mods that don't support the current graphics api will cause a crash example: tries to use opengl code when directx is running
- graphic apis engines, directx 11-12, opengl, mobile/apple(openglES, metal), vulkan

sound engine changeable per device:
- DTS:X(7.1)
- Adobe(5.1 is what I heard)
- lwjgl 3d sound

inputs:
- xbox controller
- ps5 controller
- touchscreen with zoom
- microphone(yes allowing for voice chat mods)

Mobile: adroid / IOS / IPadOS / Fire os port / Console Editions: xbox/playstation/nintendo switch
- will not support as bedrock edition has already made ports to these edition
- will not support as each one doesn't have JVM and each different graphics api
