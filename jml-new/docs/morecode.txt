chunk ideas:
integrated server: the client and server share the same byte block arrays if you are the host
slice chunk format 1x256 x 256. either 1x8 or 1x16 sub chunks. same blocks are a single index and null indexes means air
slice chunk horizatonal 1x16 x 256 starting from y<=0 single index means same blocks null means air for the world
memory mapped files for anything over 32 render and are a virtual chunk you can see them but they don't tick
boolean for int datatype else is short and treated as an unsigned short applied to the entire chunk
chunks only are tickable if there is a TE and is loaded by a chunk loader entity aka player
entities only tick if they are in a tickable chunk or are in a certain range of a chunk loader
player ticks get priority over normal entities to prevent lag
