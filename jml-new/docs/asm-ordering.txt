ASM Transformer Ordering:
re-direct grab the new name / class there
jar mod - overwrite
jar patch - overwrite
asm - overwrite
modular asm additions / removals - enums / fields / caps / methods
modular asm - overwrite, edits, injection
at - make public, generate _AT public invocation
bytecode proxy(show all asm final results in dirtyclasses.jar)

rules:
use modular asm(no dynamic patching, dynamic classes, pure bytecode edits when there is an modular asm api to prevent massive lag to class loading)
modular asm has priorties(first, least, normal, greatest, last)
generally ordering of asm should be: overwrites, edits, injections
please don't overwrite anything. If it's to fix behavior report it as a bug, if it's to change behavior please do it in a way where it's an injection as two overwrites will cause yours / others to no longer work
jar mods will conflict if two jar mods edit the same class
jar patch will conflict if two transformers edit the same method
modular asm will conflict if two transformers edit the same method
runtime will determine if the conflicts are incompatible with each other
